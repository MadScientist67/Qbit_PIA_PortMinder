# Qbit_PIA_PortMinder
Monitors Qbitorrent listening port and checks it against the forwarded port from PIA. If the ports do not match, gracefully shuts down Qbit, adjusts the port, and relaunches Qbit. 

You'll need to have the Qbit WebUI enabled for this to work. 

V2.0 has the ability to be converted to an .exe file to run locally at startup fro the systray.
